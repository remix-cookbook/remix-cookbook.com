## RemixCookbook.com source-code

Hello! üëãüèª

I'm Fabio Vedovelli ([github.com/vedovelli](https://github.com/vedovelli)) and this project is my endeavour to learn [Remix.run](https://remix.run) while building something real. This project is currently published on [Remix-Cookbook.com](https://Remix-Cookbook.com), a blog I intend to maintain for as long as I can.

Here you find instruction on how to run the project. Feel free to use it in any way you want, even to build something for yourself, commercial or personal.

### Specifics

This repository contains two separate projects:

1. `studio/` contains the [sanity.io](https://sanity.io) project, which allow us to create new schemas and build the interface to manage the data;
2. `web/` contains the Remix project with deploy configurations for [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

Each of the folders contains its down README.md with installation instructions.
